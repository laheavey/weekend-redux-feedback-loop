# React Gallery

Duration: 2 Day Sprint

Our prompt for this project was to create a feedback form using React, React routers, and Redux. Certain fields needed to be required, all inputs needed to be viewable on the final page, and inputs should be POST-ed after review. 

I began by thinking through only the base goals given and determining what steps I *might* take for each requirement. After weighing the pros and cons of my options, I plotted out a general plan. Once I'd accomplished base mode, I did the same for the stretch goals.

## Usage

This is a pretty basic feedback form. It felt important to feature all of her moods. Each image id, path, description, and likes are stored & updated on a server.

Beyond the basics...
> Pressing the red "heart" button will increase & update the number of likes on each image.
> 
> The blue "document" button will display a detailed description of each image.
>
> The image layout is responsive to window size, and should keep Mischa and her gallery appropriately scaled.


## Notes

I encountered a few different errors while working through each part of my plan, but I was able to solve each without much issue. 

The primary issue I faced was getting the "likes" to update on clicking & re-render correctly. I played around with my code a little bit, took a break and did some research, and wound up changing the location & logic of what I'd tried before to get it working.

I would have loved to do more styling, and I had to stop myself from uploading 10,000x more cat photos. I would have also liked to add a form for the user to add their own photos!
